### Warning
Even if directly downloading the zip should work fine, i suggest you to download the shader from the [release page](https://github.com/Cibbi/Toony-standard/releases), this is to be sure to have it installed in an easy to find path, and also cause i tend to add some starting matcap textures and toon ramps into the unity package that are not available from the github auto generated zip.
